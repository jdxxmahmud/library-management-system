# Fastapi

FastAPI is a modern and fast web framework for building APIs

FastAPI  supports concurrency and coroutines without importing asyncio package

One of the fastest python framworks available faster than express or nest JS [nodeJS  FW]

Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs 

Minimize code duplication(fewer bugs)

Features 

OpenAPI fro API creation, including declarations of path operations, parameters, body  request etc

Automatic data model documentation with JSON Schema (as OpenAPO itself is based on JSON Schema)

Automatic docs: Interactive API documentation (OpenAPI)

No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python. 

Fastapi uses ASGI
